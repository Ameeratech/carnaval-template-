        No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do not believe the claims of businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras website. Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who do not know better. Products or websites are not licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for all of its merchandise. In some parts of the country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true in New Orleans.      </div>

        The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year. Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat Tuesday is always the day before Ash Wednesday. Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash Wednesday. Check out our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few years      </div>

        The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes it will change from one extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes since a chilly morning may turn into a warm afternoon. Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get somewhat dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely want to bring a raincoat!      </div>

        The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans
        for Mardi Gras. This is the weekend when Bacchus and Endymion, two of
        the biggest parades of the season, roll down the streets of New Orleans.
        The streets are packed all day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers.
        If you can stay longer than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat
        Tuesday are also great days to experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another
        big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu Lundi Gras festival
        goes on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and
        seeing all of the costumes and masks is a unique and thrilling
        experience    </div>

        By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family
        celebration. Those of us who grew up in New Orleans feel guilty once our
        children have grown up and we continue going to every parade, because we
        used to use "taking the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even
        large garbage bags!) to hold all of the stuff they will catch. Throws
        often include toys, stuffed animals, beads and more.

        The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where
        no full-size parades pass anyway). We recommend seeing the parades when
        they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon, since parades can last
        until 11 p.m. near the end of the route. The Garden District portion of
        St. Charles is a family area where you will see many families staking
        out their parade watching position, having picnics, playing ball, and
        having fun under the beautiful oak trees. You don't have to worry about
        the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.

        You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in the
        suburban areas like Metairie, which is only 10 minutes away from New
        Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before Mardi Gras
        weekend, is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love
        it!           </div>

        The Mardi Gras Indians only parade on Mardi Gras day and on Super Sunday
        (generally the Sunday closest to St. Joseph’s Day in March).

        The Mardi Gras day routes are not published anywhere, but they happen in
        and around their inner city neighborhoods. Some sources say that you
        will see the Creole Wild West tribe at the corner of LaSalle and 2nd
        Streets sometime between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. after the Krewe of Zulu
        passes by. Other tribes meet at the corner of Claiborne and Orleans
        following the Zulu parade.

        The New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian Council always has their Indian Sunday
        on the third Sunday of March, around St. Joseph's Day. Their festivities
        begin at Noon in A. L. Davis Park (at Washington & LaSalle Streets)
        where the Mardi Gras Indians once again dress in their feathers and
        suits, and take to the streets to meet other "gangs."

        For the Indian Sunday parade route, visit our Super Sunday page.

        Also, the Tambourine and Fan organizations traditionally hold thier
        "Super Sunday" parade on the Sunday closest to St. Joseph's Day, with
        the event beginning at Bayou St. John. In recent years, there has been
        yet a third Super Sunday called Big Sunday that falls in April during
        the open weekend between French Quarter Festival and Jazz Fest. No
        specific details are available on these events at this time   </div></div>

        There is not a single official Mardi Gras theme since there is no single
        organization in charge of Mardi Gras. Each parade krewe decides on its
        own theme each year, which is often kept secret until the parade. Their
        costumes, floats, some of their throws, and their "official" Mardi Gras
        poster (if they have one) reflect this theme. For example, after 9/11,
        patriotic themes were popular.

        Most of the krewes are named after figures from Greek, Roman, and
